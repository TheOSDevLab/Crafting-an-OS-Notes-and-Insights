> **Random Quote:** It doesn't matter how long the path is, if you can see the next step, take it.

Welcome to the OS Development Roadmap. This guide is designed to take you from zero to kernel, starting with the absolute basics like how a CPU works, learning C and Assembly, and gradually progressing toward building your own bootloader and kernel that runs directly on hardware.

No prior experience with systems programming is required, just curiosity, patience, and a willingness to get your hands dirty with low-level code.

**Contents:**
