# Understanding basic computer architecture
> **Random Quote:** The CPU is the heart of the machine, learn its rhythm, and you can make it dance.

This roadmap outlines the essential concepts of computer architecture that must be understood before beginning OS development. A solid grasp of these fundamentals is necessary before moving on to writing low-level code.

## CPU
+ The Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
+ The boot sequence.
+ Processor modes.

## Registers
+ General purpose registers: `AX`, `BX`, `CX`, `DX`.
+ Segment registers: `CS`, `DS`, `SS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`.
+ Pointer and index registers: `SP`, `BP`, `SI`, `DI`.
+ Instruction pointer: `IP`.
+ Flags register: `FLAGS/EFLAGS`.
+ Control registers: `CR0`, `CR1`, `CR2`, `CR3`, `CR4`.

## Binary and Hexadecimal
+ Binary
+ Hexadecimal
+ Decimal
+ Converting between binary, hexadecimal and decimal
+ Bit masking

## Volatile Memory
+ RAM vs registers
+ Segmentation and Addressing
+ Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)

## Interrupts
+ System Interrupts
+ BIOS interrupts
+ Hardware interrupts
