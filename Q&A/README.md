# Q&A

**Random Quote**: Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.

This directory collects all the small but important questions that come up while working on low‑level programming and bootloader development; questions that are not directly covered in the main notes but are worth exploring in detail. Each file in this directory documents one such question along with a clear explanation, examples, and sometimes experiments to try out. Over time, this serves as a growing reference of practical insights, edge cases, and hard‑won answers that fill the gaps left by formal tutorials or textbooks.
