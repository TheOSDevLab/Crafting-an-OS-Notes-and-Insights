## Overview

Briefly describe what the bootloader project does.

Example: This project demonstrates how to initialize a stack, print text to the screen, and halt execution after boot.

### Objectives

State the key learning goals of the project.

Example:

+ Set up a proper stack segment and pointer.
+ Write a string to the screen using BIOS interrupts.
+ Halt the CPU safely after execution.

---

## How It Works

Provide a step-by-step explanation of the boot process as implemented in this project, so readers can understand the sequence without reading the full code.

Example:

1. BIOS loads the boot sector to memory at `0x7C00`.
2. The bootloader sets up the stack.
3. A message is printed to the screen using `INT 10h`.
4. The program halts execution with `HLT`.

---

## Practice Areas

Highlight the specific bootloader concepts reinforced by this project.

Example:

+ Memory layout in real mode and boot sector location.
+ Initializing and positioning the stack.
+ Using BIOS interrupts for screen output.
+ Writing minimal and functional boot sector code.

---

## Running the Project

Explain clearly how to build and test the bootloader. Include commands for assembling and running in an emulator.

Example:

```bash
# Assemble and run in QEMU
nasm -f bin bootloader.asm -o boot.img
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=boot.img
````

Or:

```bash
make
qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=boot.img
```

---

## Output and Explanation

Show the expected output from the bootloader. Then briefly describe how it confirms the bootloader logic is correct.

Example:

```
Bootloader Initialized
Stack Ready
System Halted
```

The output confirms that the bootloader executed, initialized the stack correctly, displayed the message, and halted safely.
