# Welcome to Operating System Development

> **Random Quote:** If you are not prepared to go all the way, why take the first step?

## What is Operating System Development?

Operating system (OS) development is the complex and technical process of writing software that operates without relying on an existing OS.
You are not scripting in Python on top of Linux, you are creating the foundational software that runs before Linux even starts.

This journey involves:

+ Writing bare-metal code that runs directly from BIOS or UEFI
+ Managing memory without the convenience of `malloc()`
+ Handling interrupts, timers, and CPU privilege levels
+ Creating your own standard library
+ Developing hardware drivers from scratch
+ Designing a custom system call interface
+ Bootstrapping your own userland environment

It is a blend of challenge, discovery, and late nights.
It is low-level, intricate, and often overwhelming.

Yet, it is **extremely rewarding**.

## Why Pursue It?

Firstly: the satisfaction and pride of doing something few dare to try.

Secondly: it forces you to deeply understand how computers actually function.

By building an operating system, you will learn:

+ How hardware and software interact beyond high-level abstractions
+ How the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices communicate
+ How an OS manages and coordinates the entire machine
+ Why concepts like "files" and "threads" are modern miracles

You will begin to see the CPU not as a black box that "just runs code," but as a layered system involving registers, stack frames, page tables, interrupt vectors, schedulers, and filesystems, hidden mechanisms that make modern computing possible.

## What You Will Need

+ Curiosity about how computers truly operate
+ Patience and persistence to debug complex, unintuitive issues
+ A determined mindset that does not give up easily

## Final Thoughts

Operating system development is not easy, and that is exactly the point. If you are reading this, you already have the curiosity required to begin.

Welcome to the deep end.
