# Command-line Tools

This directory does not contain notes on how to use command-line tools (e.g., what a command does, what each option/sub-command means, etc). Instead, this directory contains insights/tips on which commands to use to do certain things, when to use certain commands, which commands to avoid/be cautious about, etc.

For information on how to use the commands, what the command does, the different options/sub-commands, etc, I recommend reading the man pages (they are guaranteed to be up to date and correct).
