# Welcome to OS Development

> **Random quote:** *If you're not prepared to go all the way, why take the first step?*

So, you want to build an operating system?  
Good. You're exactly where you need to be.

## What is OS Development?

Operating system development is the art (and chaos) of writing code that runs *without* an OS underneath.  
You're not writing Python scripts *on* Linux—you’re writing the thing that runs *before* Linux even blinks awake.

You'll be dealing with:

- Bare-metal code that boots from BIOS or UEFI
- Memory management without `malloc()`
- Interrupts, timers, and CPU privilege levels
- Rolling your own standard library
- Writing drivers from scratch
- Designing your own syscall interface
- Bootstrapping a custom userland

It’s an ocean of fun, frustration, and sleepless nights.  
It’s low-level. It’s messy. It’s humbling.

And it’s **insanely rewarding**.

## Why Bother?

First: bragging rights.

Second: it forces you to understand how computers *actually* work.

Building an OS teaches you:

- How hardware and software interact beneath the abstractions
- How CPUs, memory, and devices communicate
- How an operating system juggles control over the entire machine
- Why "files," "threads," and other abstractions are modern miracles

You’ll stop seeing a CPU as “just a box that runs code” and start seeing the layers: registers, stack frames, page tables, interrupt vectors, schedulers, filesystems—all the invisible machinery powering modern systems.

## What You'll Need

- Curiosity about how computers *really* work  
- Patience for weird, cryptic bugs  
- A mindset that refuses to quit

## Final Words

OS development isn’t easy—and that’s the point.  
If you’re here, you’ve already got the curiosity and stubbornness you need.

Welcome to the deep end.

Now go build your own OS.
