For an easy-to-follow introduction to x86 Assembly, see the [Bare Metal Assembly](https://github.com/raymondmwaura-osdev/Bare-Metal-Assembly) repository. It gives step-by-step instructions, starting with setting up the environment and moving on to writing real-mode bootloaders. The material is designed especially for operating system development.
