# System Control Port A Method (Fast A20)

The Fast A20 method provides significantly faster enablement through direct hardware access.

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Read Current Port Value**

```
in al, 0x92
```

**Step 2: Set A20 Enable Bit**

```
or al, 0x02
```

**Step 3: Write Modified Value Back**

```
out 0x92, al
```

Complete implementation in three instructions:

```
in al, 0x92
or al, 0x02
out 0x92, al
```

## Critical Safety Considerations

- **Bit 0** of port 0x92 often controls a **fast reset** function
- **Bit 1** controls the A20 gate
- Accidentally setting bit 0 will trigger an immediate system reset
- Always read the current value before modification
- Never use `mov al, 0x02` alone, as this may trigger unwanted reset

## Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Extremely fast (3 instructions)
- Simple implementation
- Widely supported on 386 and later systems

**Limitations:**

- Potential to cause system reset if implemented incorrectly
- Not available on earliest IBM AT systems
- May interfere with other system control functions
