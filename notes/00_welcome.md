# Welcome to OS Development

> **Random quote:** "If you are not prepared to go all the way, why take the first step?"

So you want to build an operating system?  
Good. You're exactly where you need to be.

## What is OS Development?

Operating system development is the art (and chaos) of writing code that runs *without* another OS underneath.  
You're not writing Python scripts on top of Linux, you're writing the *thing* that boots *before* Linux even wakes up.

You'll be dealing with:
- Bare-metal code that boots from BIOS or UEFI
- Memory management without `malloc()`
- Interrupts, timers, and CPU privilege rings
- Building your own `printf()`
- Writing keyboard drivers from scratch
- Designing your own syscall interface
- Bootstrapping your own userland

It’s an ocean of fun, pain, and sleepless nights.  
It’s low-level. It’s messy. It’s humbling.

And it’s **incredibly rewarding**.

## Why Bother?

First of all: bragging rights.

Then there's the fact that it forces you to understand how a computer *actually* works.

Building an OS teaches you:
- How computers actually work under the hood
- How CPUs, memory, and devices interact
- How software manages hardware
- Why abstractions like "files" and "threads" are miracles of engineering

You stop thinking of a CPU as "just a black box that runs code" and start seeing the real layers; registers, stack frames, interrupt tables, page tables, schedulers, filesystems, all the invisible plumbing that makes modern systems tick.

## What you'll need
+ Curiosity about how computers work
+ Willingness to debug weird, confusing errors
+ An unstoppable mindset

## Final Words

OS dev isn’t easy, and that’s the point.  
If you’re here, you’ve already got curiosity and stubbornness. That’s all you need to start.

Welcome to the deep end.

Now go write your own OS.
