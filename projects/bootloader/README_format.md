## Overview

Briefly explain what the project does.

Example: This project demonstrates how to swap two variables in memory using the `XCHG` instruction.

### Objectives

State the main goals of the project.

Example:

+ Swap two variables stored in memory.
+ Display their values before and after the swap.

---

## How It Works

Provide a step-by-step summary of the program's flow so readers can follow the logic without diving straight into the source.

Example:

1. Load values from memory into registers.
2. Print the initial values.
3. Use `XCHG` to swap the registers.
4. Print the swapped values.
5. Halt the CPU.

---

## Practice Areas

List the specific concepts or skills this project helps reinforce.

Example:

+ Using `MOV` to transfer data between memory and registers.
+ Using `XCHG` to swap values without a temporary register.
+ Printing characters with `INT 10h`.
+ Structuring a minimal real-mode program.

---

## Running the Project

Explain exactly how to build and run. Include scripts or makefile instructions.

Example:

```bash
# Assemble and run.
./run.sh
```

Or:

```bash
make
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=main.img
```

---

## Output and Explanation

Show a screenshot or snippet of the program's output. Then briefly explain what the output means and how it confirms that the code works.

Example

```
Initial: A B
After Swap: B A
```

The output shows that the two values were successfully swapped.

## Notes

(Optional) Add any important observations, edge cases, or things you learned while working on the project.
