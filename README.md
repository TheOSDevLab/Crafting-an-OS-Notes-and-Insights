# Crafting an OS: Notes and Insights

Welcome to **Crafting an OS** — a living collection of notes, explanations, and examples from my journey into operating system development.

This repository is built for **all**, **beginners** who are curious about low-level magic, and **experienced developers** looking for clear and practical insights.

> Work in Progress: Just like a good OS, this project will evolve over time.
