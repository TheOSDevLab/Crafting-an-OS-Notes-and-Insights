# Crafting an OS: Notes and Insights

> **Random Quote:** The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.

Welcome to **Crafting an OS**, a living collection of notes, explanations, and examples from my journey into operating system development. I’m not dumping everything at once. These notes grow as I grow. Every page here reflects something I’ve learned, implemented, and debugged.

This repository is built for **all**; **beginners** who are curious about low-level magic, and **experienced developers** looking for clear and practical insights. Everything is written to be clear, practical, and beginner-accessible.

## What You'll Find Here

- Simple and clear explanations of core OS concepts
- Practical code examples in C and Assembly
- Beginner-friendly walkthroughs
- Diagrams and visual aids
- Well documented projects to practice what you've learnt
