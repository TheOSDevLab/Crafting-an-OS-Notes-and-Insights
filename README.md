# Crafting an OS: Notes and Insights

> **Random quote:** "This isn't just code. It's a conversation with the machine. Speak clearly, or be misunderstood."

Welcome to **Crafting an OS**, a living collection of notes, explanations, and examples from my journey into operating system development. I’m not following a rigid curriculum or dumping everything at once. These notes grow as I grow. Every page here reflects something I’ve learned, implemented, debugged (and probably broken at least once).

This repository is built for **all**, **beginners** who are curious about low-level magic, and **experienced developers** looking for clear and practical insights.

## What You'll Find Here

- Simple and clear explanations of core OS concepts
- Code examples in C, Assembly and maybe Rust
- Resources for further exploration
- Beginner-friendly walkthroughs — but not "dumbed down"
- Diagrams and visual aids (because words alone sometimes suck)
- Practice projects to avoid tutorial hell
