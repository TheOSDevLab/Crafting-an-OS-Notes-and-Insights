# Crafting an OS: Notes and Insights

> **Random Quote:** The more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.

Welcome to **Crafting an OS**, a living collection of notes, explanations, and examples from my journey into operating system development. I’m not dumping everything at once. These notes grow as I grow. Every page here reflects something I’ve learned, implemented, and debugged.

This repository is built for **all**; **beginners** who are curious about low-level magic, and **experienced developers** looking for clear and practical insights. Everything is written to be clear, practical, and beginner-accessible.

## What You'll Find Here

- Simple and clear explanations of core OS concepts
- Code examples in C, Assembly and bash
- Beginner-friendly walkthroughs
- Diagrams and visual aids
- Practice projects to avoid tutorial hell

## Repository Tour

- [**`notes/`**](./notes): The main event. In-depth notes on everything I’ve learned, clearly organized and growing steadily.
- [**`projects/`**](./projects): Hands-on projects I’ve worked on to apply what I’ve learned. Fully documented and recommended for practice.
- [**`resources/`**](./resources): PDFs, images, and other external stuff I found useful (too good to gatekeep).
- [**`roadmap/`**](./roadmap): Contains a roadmap for beginners which guide them from the very basics to building a kernel.
- [**`tools/`**](./tools): Scripts and helpers to automate the boring parts and save time.
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md): Want to help? This file tells you how; and more importantly, how *not* to.
- [glossary.md](./glossary.md): Definitions of difficult terms used throughout the notes.
- [LICENSE](./LICENSE): Legal stuff you’ll probably never read.
- [SUMMARY.md](./SUMMARY.md): An index of everything in the repo for quick navigation.
