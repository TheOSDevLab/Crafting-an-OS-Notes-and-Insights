# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in this project!

This is a **personal OS development notes repo**, built as I learn. I want to keep the content consistent with my own learning path and writing style. That means:

## ✅ What You *Can* Do

- **Report mistakes**: Typos, broken links, incorrect explanations, factual errors, all are fair game. Please open an issue or PR with the fix or report.
- **Make suggestions**: If there's a topic you'd like me to cover in the future, feel free to open an issue and suggest it.

## ❌ What You *Can't* Do

- Please **do not add new notes**, sections, or files yourself. I will only include topics I’ve already learned and documented myself.
- No unsolicited PRs that introduce new content; they'll be closed.

## Why This Restriction?

I want this to reflect my personal journey in learning OS development, written in my voice and pace. Think of this as my living notebook, just one that I'm sharing publicly.

Thanks for understanding!
