# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this project.

This repository serves as a **personal collection of notes on operating system development**, compiled as part of my ongoing learning process. The content is intentionally aligned with my individual learning path and writing style. To maintain consistency, please observe the following guidelines:

## Permitted Contributions

+ **Reporting errors**: Typographical mistakes, broken links, inaccuracies in explanations, or factual errors are all welcome to be reported. Please open an issue for such matters.  
+ **Providing suggestions**: If there is a topic you would like to see covered in the future, you are welcome to open an issue and propose it.

## Restricted Contributions

+ Please **do not add new notes, sections, or files** directly. Only topics that I have personally studied and documented will be included.  
+ Unsolicited pull requests introducing new content will be closed without review.

## Rationale for These Restrictions

This project is intended to document my personal journey in learning operating system development, expressed in my own words and at my own pace. It should be regarded as a living notebook that I have chosen to make publicly accessible.

Thank you for your understanding.
